# üß† Ethical AI Core ‚Äî ADPF & Axon OS

**An open-source foundation for building conscious, cryptographically secure, and ethically-aligned AI systems.**  

---

## ‚ú® What is Ethical AI Core?

**Ethical AI Core** is the reference implementation of the **ADPF (Archetypal Dynamics Prosperity Framework)** and its upcoming orchestration layer **Axon OS** ‚Äî designed to guide artificial intelligence using:

**ADPF Framework**
- **Multi-domain prosperity principles**</br>(Prosperity on pillars of society)
- **Prompt orchestration & friction logic for LLMs**</br>(GPT, Claude, Mistral, etc.)
    - **Cognitive archetypes**</br>(Warrior, Queen, Magician, etc.)
    - **Integrated Personas**
- **Modular reasoning systems**</br>(By creating or using **lenses**)
- **Cryptographic integrity**</br>(Signed framework & Tamper protection)

**Axon OS**
- **API management & orchestration**
- **Audit by Advocate & Governance Agent**</br>(Research platform for AGI safety and wisdom-aligned design)
- **Automated workflows**
- **Verifiable execution systems**</br>(e.g., only signed frameworks can execute)
- **Prompt signing mechanisms**
- **Multi-agent orchestration with archetypal polarity modeling**
- **Personal knowledge vaults and cognitive tooling**

This is not just another prompt framework ‚Äî it's a **next-generation architectural layer** for ethical reasoning, identity-bound execution, and archetypal intelligence modeling.
